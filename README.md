# QuickFlask

**QuickFlask** is a CLI tool designed to help you create modular, functional Flask applications in seconds. I love flask but I often found myself writing the same boilerplate code repeatedly. To save time, created QuickFlask. This tool will save you time and effort, allowing you to focus on building your application rather than setting up the initial structure. It will help you adhere to the DRY (Donâ€™t repeat yourself) principle.
